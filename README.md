# Simple-Todo-List
This project is a simple todo list web application that I created to practice my skills in JavaScript programming. The application allows users to create and manage their own todo lists, with the ability to add and delete tasks as needed.

The application uses HTML and CSS for the user interface, with JavaScript for the logic and local storage for data persistence. Local storage allows the user's data to be saved locally in the browser, making it easy to retrieve and update the todo list across sessions.
